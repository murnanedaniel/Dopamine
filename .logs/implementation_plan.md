# Dopamine - Habit Formation App Implementation Plan

## Design Philosophy ✓
- Minimalist and clean visual design
- Focus on user interaction and feedback
- Module-based component architecture
- Clear separation of concerns

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure ✓
- Initialize React project with Create React App ✓
- Set up Git repository ✓
- Configure project structure ✓
  ```
  src/
  ├── components/
  │   ├── core/
  │   ├── dice/
  │   ├── rewards/
  │   └── common/
  ├── hooks/
  ├── utils/
  ├── styles/
  └── context/
  ```
- Configure dependencies ✓
  - React Router for navigation ✓
  - Styled Components for styling ✓
  - Framer Motion for animations ✓
  - TypeScript setup ✓
  - Type definitions ✓

## Phase 2: Core Components Development
- Basic App Container ✓
- Theme Provider ✓
- Global Styles ✓

### Dice Component ✓
- Large, centered interactive dice button ✓
- Smooth roll animation ✓
- Clear success/failure state display ✓
- Minimal visual feedback ✓

### Reward Randomization Components (Revised)
- Goal Wheel Spinner
  - Circular wheel with all funding goals
  - Smooth spinning animation
  - Realistic deceleration
  - Visual highlight of selected goal
  - Goals:
    - Books
    - Robotics
    - Travels
    - Stocks
    - Long-term savings
    - Entrepreneurship

- Contribution Type Coin Flip
  - 3D coin flip animation
  - Time/Money sides
  - Realistic physics
  - Landing animation

- Amount Spinner
  - Slot machine style spinner
  - Logarithmic probability distribution
  - Ranges:
    - Money: $1 - $100
    - Time: 1 - 120 minutes
  - Visual momentum and deceleration

## Phase 3: State Management & Business Logic

### Local Storage Integration ✓
- Efficient storage schema ✓
- Clean persistence layer ✓
- Error handling ✓

### Core Game Logic
- Dice roll mechanics ✓
  - Success: 4-6 ✓
  - Failure: 1-3 ✓
- Reward Randomization Logic (New)
  - Goal selection probability distribution
  - 50/50 contribution type
  - Logarithmic amount distribution
  - Chained animation sequencing
  - State management for multi-step reveal

## Phase 4: UI/UX Enhancement

### Animations & Transitions
- Dice roll physics ✓
- Wheel spinning mechanics
- Coin flip physics
- Amount spinner momentum
- Chained animation flow
- Success/failure states ✓

### Visual Design
- Consistent spacing and alignment ✓
- Clear typography hierarchy ✓
- Minimal color palette ✓
- Strategic use of whitespace ✓
- Engaging spinner designs
- Realistic physics feel

## Phase 5: Testing & Deployment

### Testing
